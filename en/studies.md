# Education

The Multimedia and Authorship master's program explores the topics of the digital age and reflects them with media resources.

In addition to practical media training focusing on digital journalism, we offer classes on media science which **discuss and explore journalism** and topics of the digital present. The aim is to successfully develop and implement media and scientific projects during the program both in teams and individually.

At the end of the program, the graduate will have developed a relevant portfolio for their own career entry. In addition, they will have the ability to combine media theory and praxis in journalistic, investigative and scientific, argumentative formats.

## Practice

In the practical section, the program **focuses on digital journalism and storytelling**. This includes practical media productions, format development and media prototyping. The program conveys journalistic craft in the areas of text, image, sound and audiovisual media, and their interaction in multimedia projects. The study offers space to try new methods and experiment with different formats. Realization of these projects is encouraged through provision of knowledge about flexible project management and creative techniques.

Within the first three semesters, students **develop and realize** the following media products:

- classic forms of journalistic representation such as news articles and interviews
- journalistic contributions and formats for social media
- video contributions of different lengths
- programming websites with HTML and CSS and publication using content management systems such as WordPress
- photo projects and visual design work
- development of journalistic projects and formats
- a journalistic class project

In the practical work, students will be able to deal with design, audio and video editing programs as well as markup languages.

A **class project** in the third semester builds on what has been learned and also offers the opportunity to develop additional formats such as podcasts, newsletters or scrollytelling projects at the request of the students. Also, students can attempt investigative research and data visualizations.

## Theory

Seminars on media science that explore topics in the field of tension between information technology and society constitute the program's academic basis. At the end of their studies, the graduate will have a deeper knowledge and understanding of the **central approaches, methods and terms of media science**. In particular, they include media dramaturgy and the history of mass media. Students apply their acquired knowledge and understanding independently to current problems and topics of digital cultures such as disinformation, big data, algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital markets.

In addition to research questions pertaining to media science and communication studies, new **interdisciplinary interfaces** are being sought for social and cultural anthropology, sociology, law, computer science, medicine and other disciplines that reflect the journalistic work and provide for students' media praxis.

## Graduation

The program's construction, which includes praxis and theory, is also reflected in the conclusion of the Multimedia and Authorship master's degree. This consists of an independently implemented and [published media project](/showroom) and a scientific master's thesis.
