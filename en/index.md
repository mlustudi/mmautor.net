MMA stands for the **Multimedia and Authorship** master's program in Halle an der Saale. With us, individuals who are interested in media come together from different disciplines to explore the topics of the digital present and to reflect them in journalistic projects.

We offer a master's program in media science coupled with praxis-oriented training which focuses on **digital journalism**. Together with our partners from media, culture and science, we would like to provide inspiration for social and academic discourse. Join us and help shape the program through your topics, interests and networks.
