_MMA_ stands for the master's degree **multimedia and authorship** in Halle (Saale). Media-savvy people from different disciplines come together to research the topics of the digital present and reflect on them in journalistic projects. We offer a media science masterâ€™s degree that is coupled with practical training, focussing on **digital journalism**. Together with our partners from media, culture and science, we want to provide impetus for social and academic discourse. Become a part of us and help shape the course through your topics, interests and networks.
