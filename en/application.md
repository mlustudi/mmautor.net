# Application

You want to apply? Registering for the Multimedia and Authorship master’s program is possible in odd years only, by May 15. Information can be found here or on the website of [Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg](https://studienangebot.uni-halle.de/multimedia-und-autorschaft-master-120).

## Prerequisites

Admission to the master's program requires that you have a degree that provides professional qualifications (bachelor's or higher). Preferred are those from the humanities, social sciences, cultural studies or comparable disciplines, though students from other fields are also welcome. 

The master's program currently has open admission (i.e. no NC, numerus clasus), though there is an entrance test that must be passed.

If your degree will not be available until after the application deadline, you can submit a transcript that covers at least 2/3 of the courses required for your field of study along with the other application materials. For registration in the winter semester, the degree must then be submitted by January 31 of the following year at the latest.

Students from a variety of fields who have different interests and experience come together in our program. What they all have in common is a receptiveness to digital media and journalism, curiosity about new fields of knowledge, interest in scientific study of topics involving the digital present and eagerness to work in a team while realizing a variety of projects. 

Since the program focuses on practical application, you should have your own notebook computer and bring it to class. Should financial or technical help be required, please contact [maren.schuster@medienkomm.uni-halle.de](mailto:maren.schuster@medienkomm.uni-halle.de).
 
## Admission Process

### Application for the entrance test

Admission to the master's program requires passing an entrance test, which is in the form of an interview. For an invitation, submit a application for admission, which consists of the following documents:

- a request to take part in an entrance interview (in the form of a cover letter)
- a written report (email) of about two DIN A4 pages listing your personal and subject-specific reasons for applying to the Multimedia and Authorship master's program
- [the completed questionnaire](https://www.verwaltung.uni-halle.de/KANZLER/ZGST/ABL/2020/20_11_10.pdf)

#### Application tips:
