## Education

The master’s degree in _Multimedia and Authorship_ explores the topics of the digital age and reflects them with media.

In addition to practical media training with a focus on digital journalism, we offer media science seminars that **discuss and research** journalism and topics of the digital present. The aim is to successfully develop and implement media and scientific projects during the master’s degree, both as a team and individually. At the end of their studies, the graduates have developed a relevant portfolio for their own career entry. In addition, they have the ability to combine theory and practice of the media in journalistic, investigative and scientific-argumentative formats.

## The Practice

In the applied part, the master’s **focus is on digital journalism and storytelling**. This includes practical media productions, format developments and media prototyping. The course teaches journalistic skills in the areas of text, image, sound, audiovisual media and their interaction in multimedia projects. The course offers space to try out and experiment with different formats. The implementation of these projects is promoted by imparting knowledge about agile project management and creative techniques.

During the first 3 semesters, the students **develop and implement** the following media products:

- classic journalistic forms of presentation such as news, reports and interviews,
- Video contributions of different lengths,
- Programming of websites with HTML and CSS and publication using content management systems such as Wordpress
- short journalistic articles and reports on social media channels,
- Photo projects and visual artwork.

Through the practical work, the students acquire knowledge in dealing with various design, audio and video editing programs as well as markup languages. A **joint class project** in the third semester builds on what has been learned and also offers the possibility of developing other formats such as podcasts, newsletters or scrollytelling projects at the request of the students. Students can also try out investigative research and data visualization.

## Theory

The high practical component of the course is supplemented by scientific seminars that research topics in the field of tension between information technology and society. At the end of their studies, the graduates will have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the **central approaches, methods and terms of media studies**. This includes in particular media dramaturgy and the history of the mass media. The students apply the acquired knowledge and understanding independently to current problem and topic areas of digital cultures and examine how these are currently negotiated under terms such as disinformation, big data, algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital markets.

In addition to media and communication science research questions, new **interdisciplinary interfaces** to social and cultural anthropology, sociology, law, computer science, medicine and other disciplines are constantly sought, which reflect the journalistic work and provide new impetus for the media practice of the students.

## Graduation

The practical-theoretical structure of the course is also reflected in the completion of the Masters in Multimedia and Authorship. This consists of an independently implemented and [published media project](/showroom) and a scientific master's thesis.
