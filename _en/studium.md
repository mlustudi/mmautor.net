# Education

The master's degree program _Multimedia and Authorship_ explores the topics of digital time and reflects them with medial ressources.

In addition to a practical media training focusing on digital journalism, we offer media scientific seminars that **discuss and explore journalism** and topics of the digital present. The aim is to successfully develop and implement media and scientific projects during the Master's program both in the team and individually.

At the end of the studies, the graduate has developed a relevant portfolio for their own career entry. In addition, they have the ability to combine theory and practice of the media in journalistic, investigative and scientific-argumentative formats.

## Practice

In the applied part, the master puts its **focus on digital journalism and storytelling**. This includes practical media productions, format developments and medial prototyping. The study program conveys journalistic craft in the areas of text, image, sound, audiovisual media and its interaction in multimedia projects. The study offers space to try out and experiment with different formats. The implementation of these projects is funded by providing knowledge about agile project management and creative techniques.

Within the first 3 semesters **develop and realize** the students following media products:

- classic journalistic shapes such as message, report and interview,
- Journalistic contributions and formats for social media,
- Video contributions of different length,
- Programming websites with HTML and CSS and publication using content management systems like WordPress
- Photoprojects and visual design work
- Journalistic project and format development
- a journalistic vintage project

Through the practical work, students are suitable for dealing with design, audio and video editing programs as well as markup languages.

A **community project** in the 3rd semester builds on the learned and also offers the opportunity to develop further formats such as podcasts, newsletters or scrollytelling projects at the request of the students. Also, students can try out investigative research and data visualizations.

## Theory

Media-scientific seminars that explore topics in the field of tension of information technology and society are the academic basis of the master. At the end of your studies, the graduate have a deeper knowledge and understanding of the **central approaches, methods and terms of media science**. These include, in particular media debt and the history of mass media. Students use the acquired knowledge and understanding independently to current problem and topics of digital cultures and examine how these are currently under negotiated under terms such as disinformation, big data, algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital markets.

In addition to media and communication scientific research questions, new **interdisciplinary interfaces** are being sought for social and cultural anthropology, sociology, law, computer science, medicine and other disciplines that reflect the journalistic work and give new impulses for the media practice of students.

## Graduation

The practical-theoretical construction of the study is also reflected in the conclusion of the Master _Multimedia and Authorship_. This consists of an independently implemented and [published media project](/showroom) and a scientific master's thesis.
