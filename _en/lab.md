# Lab

The degree program _Multimedia and Authorship sees itself as a laboratory for science and digital journalism. In different formats and projects, we bring together scientific disciplines as well as media and cultural enterprises to **explore relevant questions of the present scientifically and media practically**. As a university master program, we enjoy the freedom to take risks.

Our study content live from the commitment and topic wishes of the students as well as of the questions and ideas of our partners from science, journalism, culture and creative industries. We are open to cooperations as well as people and media projects looking for a **professional experimental field** or collaboration.

We actively assist ourselves self-critically with their own diversity and questions of **representation and discrimination in scientific and journalistic production**. Our claim is therefore also to scientifically and journalist unpleasant or previously passed topics. Here you will find a selection of our projects of recent years.

## Digital Talks

The talk and workshop format _Digital Talks_ brings journalists and scientists together in an academic environment and thus stimulates the **interdisciplinary exchange between research and journalism**. Thus, we set impetus for the scientific and media-practical work at our Department of Media and Communication Science.

For example, in the past, ethnology met journalism: the author and producer [Frédéric Dubois](https://twitter.com/fredericdubois) showed students of ethnology and _Multimedia and Authorship_ excerpts from his interactive documentary film project [Field Trip](https://fieldtrip.tagesspiegel.de/?ref=mmautor.net) about the Tempelhofer field in Berlin. Subsequently, students discussed with him about journalistic and ethnological field work. Students and the participating researchers were able to win impulses for their own projects.

This **discussion about ethnological and journalistic work** was particularly reflected in the format developments of our _MMA_ students, resulting in the seminar "Dis-Harmonies: Anthropological Views and Medial Constructions of the Other". Under anthropological and ethnological point of view, media formats were developed that deal with differentiating perspectives on the politically others, socially despised or personal repulsive.

The Format _Digital Talks_ was initiated by [Patrick Vonderau](https://www.medienkomm.uni-halle.de/abteilung/mitarbeiter/vonderau/?ref=mmautor.net) and [Maren Schuster](https://www.medienkomm.uni-halle.de/abteilung/mitarbeiter/schuster/?ref=mmautor.net). They implemented the exchange to cross-cutting topics such as digital methods or representation. Further information can be found on the website of the Department of [Media and Communication Science](https://www.medienkomm.uni-halle.de/initiativen/digital_talks/?ref=mmautor.net).

## "Diagnosis: Invisible", transfer project medicine and media

[Diagnosis: Invisible](https://diagnosis-unichtichtar.medienkomm.uni-halle.de/?ref=mmautor.net) ("Diagnose: Unsichtbar") is a journalistic project that examines the **impact of social inequality on health**. The Master class 2019-2021 developed together with medical students formats that deal with social medical topics.

The physicians shared their expertise with our students and together the scientific jargon was converted into a language more **accessible to the target groups**. Thus, it could be guaranteed that the symptoms, prevention measures and problems are easier to understand, but correctly displayed.

For the doctors this cooperation offered the opportunity to consider the medicine undertakings and develop new ways as well as ideas, how to **deal with social medicine** and how to bear the knowledge into a general public. The experience of this cooperation can be transported in theis professional field. In addition, a network of physicians and journalists formed, which may be also used for other projects.

As result there was create the podcast **Unbehandelt**, the social medicine newsletter **Upstream**, the multimedia longread **Von ungleichen (T)Räumen** and the journalistic Instagram project [@bittere.pille](https://www.instagram.com/bittere.pille/?ref=mmautor.net).

Conceptually and journalistic, Maren Schuster was responsible for the project. [Amand Führer](https://www.medizin.uni-halle.de/einrichtungen/institute/medizinische-epidemiologie-biometrie-und-informatik/team/fuehrer-amand-gabriel?ref=mmautor.net), researcher at the Institute of Epidemiology, Biometry and Computer Science of the MLU, supported the project professionally as a physician and with its network. Inputs of scientists and journalists to podcasting, journalism at Instagram and data journalism accompanied the project _Diagnosis: Invisible_ in the implementation phase.

The transfer project was also supported by the [Transfer- und Gründerservice](https://www.gruendung.uni-halle.de/?ref=mmautor.net) of the MLU. They financed e.g. a design thinking workshop by Jonas Kirel, Franziska Gerlow and Paul Schweidler from [Gerlow+Kühl](https://www.gerlow-kuehl.de/?ref=mmautor.net) for the development phase. In addition, _Diagnosis: Invisible_ was supported by the international media network [Are We Europe](https://areweeurope.com/?ref=mmautor.net), so that a part of the project was implemented in English with a European and crossborderjournalist perspective.

## Particulate Matter: Sensor journalism, Bots and Citizens Science

The **theme particulate matter** convinced us because it is scientifically and journalistic challenging. For the master _Multimedia and Authorship_ it was the **entry into the science journalism**, at the same time we wanted to test with MDR Saxony-Anhalt Online_, to what extent sensor data is journalistic usable and interesting for the audience.

Professionally, the _leibnitz Institut Leipzig, Tropos_ supported us. The sensor technology has set the _fraunhofer IMWS_ in the course of the Citizens Sciens project _The surveying of the world 2.0_ and explains us together with the _ own construction combination_.

Inputs ** Data and Sensor Journalism **, ** Ki ** and ** Bot Technology ** and a workshop on science journalism were the starting point to find out with a design linking with all those involved researchers and students who are journalistic approaches and formats are load-bearing.

The result is a [Scrollytelling format about the fine dust measurement with bees] (https://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/halle/halle/feinstaub-studentprojekt-un-halle-selbstürstürstung-studientend-messen- airqualitaet-100. HTML?

Dustin Air responds to keywords such as barbecue or printer and provides entertaining facts for air pollution potential. Twitter has turned off Dustin, but his answers and all projects are published at [MDR Saxony-Anhalt Online] (https://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/index.html?ref=mmautor.net).

## Media and new rights

At the request of the students, we have been intensively dealing with the new right for years. As an institute that researches media effects and the media producer: forms the inside of tomorrow, we see each other in a ** special responsibility **, to analyze, such as right-wing radicals and right-wing extreme actor: inside media and media attention.

### Is what? New rights in the field of vision of journalism, science and civil society

In September 2018 followed lecturers and students of our department, journalist: inside, scientists: in various disciplines as well as civil society and cultural actor: inside from Central Germany, Berlin and Vienna of our invitation to exchange views over the ** media representation of the new right **.

Together with our lecturers Maren Schuster and [Claudia Böttcher] (https://hait.tu-dresden.de/ext/institut/miterprofil-38/?ref=mmautor.net), a historian and media scientist, designed and realized the students In the seminar "Media and New Rights" the [Workshop Meeting] of the same name (https://www.campus-halensis.de/artikel/neue- rights- stagen-reisen/?ref=mmautor.net). At the same time, we interviewed for our media-practical seminars people who scientifically, artistically or politically deal with the topic and worked on visual strategies in journalistic handling of the new rights.

### What is it? Scientific investigations of the new rights

All students of the Masters _Multimedia and Autoresges_ received the chance to participate in a winter school to _ communication patterns of radicalization. A Viennese research group brokered its methodology in the ** research of radicalization processes in social media ** and led parallel to a media usage experiment with the students of the audiovisual representation of the audiovisual representation of linker and right violence.

From this our students ** pulses could take their own research practice **. Based on the Viennese research work several master theses, u. A. A deplatforming of the _identicipate movement_ and their migration of social media into telegram groups.

### It is something! Journalistic reflections about the new rights

How do Journalist: Inside with representative: inside the so-called new right? Where is the border between necessary reporting and where does the podium begin for human-illuminating ideologies? This and other questions are dedicated to the ** theme book ** _IST What? Media and journalism in times of new rights_. This is an interdisciplinary study project, the [Gitte Kießling] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitte-kie%C3%9fling-b254b5190/?ref=mmautor.net) and Maren Schuster as senior lecturers of _multimedia and autoreship_ together with the students and in cooperation with the graphic designer [Andine Müller] (https://www.hmkw.de/hochschule/mührende/fachbereich-design/andine-mueller/?ref=mautor.net) of the University of Media, Communication and Business Berlin have implemented.

The magazine also reflects the mentioned questions in its media trade and lets the boundaries between scientific, journalistic and artistic approaches. It is in [Vistas Verlag] (https://www.vistas.de/?ref=mmautor.net) with the support of the [Network Research e. V.] (https://netzwerkCrecherche.org/?ref=mmautor.net) appeared.
