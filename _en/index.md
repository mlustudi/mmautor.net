_MMA_ stands for the master's program **Multimedia and Authorship** in Halle (Saale). With us, media affine people come together from different disciplines to explore the topics of the digital present and to reflect on them in journalistic projects.

We offer a media scientific master program coupled to a practical training with a focus on **digital journalism**. Together with our partners from media, culture and science we would like to set impulses for the social and academic discourse. Become part and shape the degree program through your topics, interests and networks.
